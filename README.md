# NBI

1. NBIfunc.py
   Include all the functions used in data simulation and NBI calculation.
   
2. NBI_screening.py
   Include codes to run simulation for multiple-variable-based decision rule evaluation (described in Section 4.2). 
   The specific setting given is to run the linear scenario with n=1000. But it is easy to modify the code to run other scenarios. 
   Other simulations described in the paper can be easily adjusted from the given code.
